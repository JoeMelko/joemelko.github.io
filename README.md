# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple single-file personal website. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site.

The site includes:

- **Blog** section that lets you drag and drop a file (such as a LaTeX document, text file, or PDF) and open it locally

No build step is required. Simply open the file directly.

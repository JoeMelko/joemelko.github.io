# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple personal website. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main page.

The site includes:

- **About** section
- **Previous Work** section with sample project links
- **Blog** page that renders posts written in Markdown

Blog posts live in the `posts/` directory. Open a post by visiting
`blog.html?post=<slug>`, for example `blog.html?post=hello-world`.

No build step is required. Simply open the files directly in your browser.
